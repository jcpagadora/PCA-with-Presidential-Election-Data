# PCA-with-Presidential-Election-Data

This is a notebook in which I demonstrate an interesting application of Principal Components Analysis on political data.
In this notebook, I pull and clean data from a website (Wikipedia) using BeautifulSoup.

Note: There is an interactive plot that is created using `plotly.express` which does not have functionality in the notebook when viewing it on github. Please make sure to have a local copy of the notebook or html in order to be able to use it.
