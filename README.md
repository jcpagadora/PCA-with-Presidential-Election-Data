# PCA-with-Presidential-Election-Data

This is a notebook in which I demonstrate an interesting application of Principal Components Analysis on political data.
In this notebook, I pull and clean data from a website (Wikipedia) using BeautifulSoup.

Note: There is an interactive plot that is created using `plotly.express` which does not have functionality in the notebook. Please look at the html file to see it.
